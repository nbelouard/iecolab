Welcome to the iEcoLab -- the Integrative Ecology Lab run jointly by Jocelyn Behm and Matthew Helmus at the Center for Biodiversity in the Biology Department at Temple University, Philadelphia, USA. The mission of the iEcoLab is to integrate biodiversity science with human ecology to understand contemporary patterns of biodiversity and its functioning within ecosystems.

As part of the FOSS 2020 course, we developed a Data Management Plan (DMP) and established the typical workflow for any project led by our teams.
